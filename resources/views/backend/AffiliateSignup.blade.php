                    <h2>What does it mean to be an "Affiliate"</h2>

                    <p><strong><em>Affiliate Definition:</em></strong> A way for a company (Leased<strong>Ad</strong>Space) to sell its products and services by signing up individuals or companies ("affiliates") who market the company's products and services for a commission.</p>

                    <p>Each Leased<strong>Ad</strong>Space affiliate is an independent contractor  and not an employee. Nothing herein is intended to create an employer/employee relationship.</p>

                    <h2>Affiliate/Admin Fee</h2>

                    <p>Each person wanting to enter into an affiliate relationship with Leased<strong>Ad</strong>Space, agrees to pay a $10.00 one-time non-refundable Affiliate/Admin Fee. This fee helps Leased<strong>Ad</strong>Space cover expenses and set up of your affiliate account, and costs associated with paying of and managing of your affiliate commissions.</p>

                    <p>All persons who joined Leased<strong>Ad</strong>Space before June 30th 2018, and who had previously purchased a traffic package product from Leased<strong>Ad</strong>Space, are grand fathered in, and are exempt from (do not have to pay) the Affiliate/Admin Fee.</p>

                    <h2>Earning Commissions</h2>

                    <p>You earn commissions by advertising our products and services using your Leased<strong>Ad</strong>Space affiliate links, which we provide you with. When someone registers for a account at Leased<strong>Ad</strong>Space through your affiliate link, they become your "referral". If at that time, or any future time, your referral purchases any commission eligible product or service that we offer at Leased<strong>Ad</strong>Space, you will then earn a commission, providing you affiliate account is active and in good standing.  Currently, commission eligible products include all 7 of the Leased<strong>Ad</strong>Space Traffic Packages, and ParaAds in 5 day, 10 day, 20 day durations.</p>

                    <p>You do not earn a referral fee for for your "referral's" registration nor is the Affiliate/Admin Setup Fee eligible for commissions. You earn commissions only from products and services that your referral's purchase.</p>

                    <p>This is a one-tier affiliate program, and you are not paid anything from the marketing efforts of your referrals.  This affiliate programs is not a multi-level marketing (MLM) program</p>

                    <h2>Affiliate In Good Standing</h2>
                    <p>You are qualified to receive the commission on a sale if you are what we refer to as "an affiliate in good standing". We require that affiliates be actively working at their affiliate business, and have a viable method of communicating with us in order to earn commissions.  The requirements for being "an affiliate in good standing" are as follows:</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>New affiliates must pay a one time setup fee of $10.  Leased<strong>Ad</strong>Space members who signed up prior to June 30th 2018 and who already own at least one traffic package are grandfathered in and are not required to pay this fee.  The fee is payable only once, regardless of how many times you disable and enable your affiliate services.</li>
                        <li>If you are a US resident, you must provide us with a fully executed copy of a IRS W9 form.  Instructions for providing this can be found in the affliiates tools area of your backoffice.</li>
                        <li>You must have qualifying activity on your account in the prior 180 days.  Qualifying activity includes: logging in to your LAS account, using any of your purchased LAS advertising services and receiving inbound hits to your affiliate link.  If your account goes dormant for 180 days or more in any of the previously listed ways, we will immediately deactivate your affiliate account.  If your affiliate account is deactivated, you will not be eligible for commissions during the period of deactivation, nor will hits to your affiliate ID be counted as "referrals".</li>
                        <li>You must maintain a valid, active, and "non bouncing" email address where we can reach you with information regarding your LAS affiliate account.  If your email bounces when we try and reach you we will <em>immediately</em> suspend your affiliate status.</li>
                        <li>You must be able to receive your commission payments via one of: PayPal, Bitcoin.</li>
                    </ol><p></p>

                    <h2>Our Commissions Rate is as follows</h2>

                    <p>If you are a registered affiliate only, and do not own any of our products, you will earn a 25% commission on each of our products and services you sell.</p>

                    <p>If you are a registered affiliate and own at least one of our products, your commission rate will be increased to 50% on each of our products and services you sell.</p>

                    <p>If you are a Red Diamond, meaning you own all 7 of the traffic packages that we sell, your commission rate will be increased to 75% on each of our products and services you sell.  Details on the 7 traffic packages can be found here:  <a href="https://www.leasedadspace.com/howItWorks/advertiser">http://www.leasedadspace.com/howItWorks/advertiser</a></p>

                    <p>All commissions are based on the sale price of the product, minus a 3% payment processor fee. In other words, all payment processor fees are first deducted from your total commissions earned before you are paid.</p>

                    <h2>COMMISSION SCHEDULE</h2>

                    <p>There is a minimum commission payout amount of $25.00. This is the minimum amount that you must earn before you will be paid commissions. In any 30 day commission period, your commission must exceed this amount before you will receive any sums for that period. Commissions below this minimum amount will be held until such time as the commission equals or exceeds this amount.</p>

                    <p>Commissions are paid once per month, beginning on the 15th of the month for the prior months earned commissions that exceed $25.</p>


                    <p>Commissions are not paid for any sales for which payment has not been received, or for any transaction that has been canceled, rejected or refunded for any reason.</p>

                    <p>We are not responsible for paying interest to affiliates for accrued but not yet delivered commission payments.</p>

                    <p>If a transaction incurs a charge-back, or if an online transaction is not fully completed or for any reason funds were not received in full, no commission payment is due to the affiliate. If a commission has already been paid, then it will be deducted from an active affiliate's future commissions.</p>

                    <p>All commissions are paid in US Dollars by means deemed appropriate.</p>

                    <p>Each affiliate is responsible for selecting a payment processor from the list of Leased<strong>Ad</strong>Space supported payment processors for the payment of their commissions. If you elect a payment processor through which to receive your commissions, and you later terminate the account or the account becomes unavailable for any reason, Leased<strong>Ad</strong>Space is not responsible for your not receiving the money.  An example of this scenario would be choosing Bitcoin as the commission payout method, and then losing access to the bitcoin wallet.</p>

                    <p>Each affiliate is responsible for always maintaining the payment processor through which they receive their commissions OR selecting an alternate method of payment supported by Leased<strong>Ad</strong>Space. This election is entirely made by the affiliate and Leased<strong>Ad</strong>Space assumes no responsibility for non-receipt of payments made according to the payment processor elected by the affiliate, or the affiliate's lack of ability to then conform to the payment processors or processes supported by Leased<strong>Ad</strong>Space.</p>

                    <p>Leased<strong>Ad</strong>Space assumes no responsibility for an affiliate not electing a payment processor. If an affiliate fails to elect a payment processor, any sums due will be paid by method deemed appropriate by Leased<strong>Ad</strong>Space, and any applicable fees will be deducted.</p>

                    <h2>AFFILIATE SALES &amp; TRACKING</h2>
                    <p>After agreeing to and registering for the Leased<strong>Ad</strong>Space affiliate program, you will receive unique affiliate links which you will use to advertise Leased<strong>Ad</strong>Space. When someone clicks one of these links, a cookie will be set in their browser with your affiliate ID.  When that new customer then registers for a new account, providing the cookie is still in place and has not been cleared, your affiliate ID will be permanently stored in the new users account record as the "referrer".  Any future purchase the new user makes will be credited to you and eligible for commissions providing you are an "affiliate in good standing".  Cookies are only utilized to track the referrer id until such time as an account is created and we can permanently store the referrer in the database.</p>

                    <p>In order to receive proper credit for sales, a person or entity must register through your unique affiliate links. Masking or cloaking of these links (whether done by software or by a script and sometimes referred to as "affiliate link cloaking") may or may not work with parts of the Leased<strong>Ad</strong>Space sites. Leased<strong>Ad</strong>Space is not responsible for lost sales due to the use of masking or cloaking of their affiliate links.</p>

                    <h2>Income Tax Liabilities</h2>
                    <p>Each affiliate acts as an independent contractor and as such is responsible for any or all United States, state, or foreign income taxes and any other tax liabilities that affect or concern the sales of the products or services, in your state or location. Leased<strong>Ad</strong>Space will report by law, and where applicable any commissions earned as pursuant to the United States Internal Revenue Service laws (also known as the United States Tax Code) and other applicable laws. It is the affiliate's sole responsibility to pay all taxes on commissions earned, and products sold as pursuant of their countries, governments laws.</p>

                    <h2>Embargoed Nations &amp; Specifically Designated Nationals</h2>
                    <p>The United States controls the export of products and information. Each affiliate agrees to comply with such restrictions and to not export or re-export the materials (including software) to countries or persons prohibited under the export control laws. By becoming an affiliate, you are agreeing that you are not in a country where such export is prohibited or are not a person or entity to which export is prohibited. You are responsible for compliance with the laws of your local jurisdiction with regard to the import, export, or re-export of the materials (including software and digitally delivered products).</p>

The products and/or services are exported from the United States in accordance with the Export Administration Regulations. Diversion to other countries is contrary to U.S. law and is prohibited.</p>
